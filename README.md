# OptiConnect

OptiConnect is a plugin i have been developing for a few months now and aims to reduce lag on servers

This plugin is mainly aimed at 5-10 player multiplayer servers.

One of its main fetures is that it uses MultiPaper, an API that isolates differant players on seperate partions of the drive making the server less laggy.

***The huge red spikes on the right picture are becasuse of unoptimised server sofware, and becasue Minecraft is poorly coded, the CPU is not able to handle simple things like player counts over 5 as it cant take advantage of all the CPU cores.***
