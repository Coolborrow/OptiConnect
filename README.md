# OptiConnect

OptiConnect is a plugin i have been developing for a few months now and aims to reduce lag on servers

This plugin is mainly aimed at 5-10 player multiplayer servers.

One of its main fetures is that it uses MultiPaper, an API that isolates differant players on seperate partions of the drive making the server less laggy.
